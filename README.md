LabWiki
=======

A LabWiki interface using Ruby on Rails, aiming to make the creating of a OEDL script easier, and that already gets each node information(IP) from a postgres database.

Using mostly Rails and Javascript+CSS+HTML for the interface.

In this project, i'm using BCrypt for encrypting the user's data, postgres as the database, FileSaver.js for saving the OEDL script and returning it to the user, the twitter bootstrap for the interface and JQuery for the drag and drop funcionality.
