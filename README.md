LabWiki
=======

A LabWiki interface using Ruby on Rails, aiming to make the creating of a OEDL script easier, and that already gets the node's information from a postgres database.


Using mostly Rails and Javascript, with CSS on some parts for the interface.

In this project, i'm using BCrupt for encrypting the user's data, postgres as the database, FileSaver.js for saving the OEDL script, the twitter bootstrap for the interface and JQuery for fixing some things in the interface too.
